        <h1>About me</h1>
        <article>
            <p>This website is intended to showcase my work as a web development professional. I'm currently joining this working field and I'm always studying and looking forward to improve my skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The main idea here is to show my evolution as a professional, that is, depending on when you visit this page, it can be (completely) different.</p>

            <h1>Résumé</h1>
            <p>I wasn't always passionate about technology. In fact, I just can't remember when I began to be so curious. Maybe that's why I've always liked to investigate how things work. This have led me a bit later to my adventure in the world of Chemistry, which I still have great interest. So at the end of 2011 I was graduating with an Associate's degree in Chemistry. Although I'd been true happy within the school, the lack of opportunities to work in the field ended up keeping me far away from the labs. But, as I said before, I'm driven by knowledge and so in 2014 I enrolled in a History course at a federal university in Brazil. Four years later I was leaving the institution with a Bachelor's degree in History and, this time, with hope of being my real life choice. But, <q>[...] the world ain't all sunshine and rainbows[...]</q> and as the time was passing by I realized that professionaly I couldn't fit an so I'm here now developing this website to challenge myself and to show my skills in front-end development. You can also check out my instagram page at the bottom where I show computers that I've build. Thanks for coming!</p>
